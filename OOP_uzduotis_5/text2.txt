ah shut up dursley yeh great prune said the giant he reached over
the back of the sofa jerked the gun out of uncle vernon's hands bent
it into a knot as easily as if it had been made of rubber and threw it
into a corner of the room
uncle vernon made another funny noise like a mouse being trodden on
anyway  harry said the giant turning his back on the dursleys a
very happy birthday to yeh got summat fer yeh here  i mighta sat on
it at some point but it'll taste all right
from an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled a slightly
squashed box harry opened it with trembling fingers inside was a
large sticky chocolate cake with happy birthday harry written on it in
green icing
harry looked up at the giant he meant to say thank you but the words
got lost on the way to his mouth and what he said instead was who are
you
the giant chuckled
true i haven't introduced meself rubeus hagrid keeper of keys and
grounds at hogwarts
he held out an enormous hand and shook harry's whole arm
what about that tea then eh he said rubbing his hands together
i'd not say no ter summat stronger if yeh've got it mind
his eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled chip bags in it and
he snorted he bent down over the fireplace they couldn't see what he
was doing but when he drew back a second later there was a roaring fire
there it filled the whole damp hut with flickering light and harry felt
the warmth wash over him as though he'd sunk into a hot bath
the giant sat back down on the sofa which sagged under his weight and
began taking all sorts of things out of the pockets of his coat a
copper kettle a squashy package of sausages a poker a teapot several
chipped mugs and a bottle of some amber liquid that he took a swig from
before starting to make tea soon the hut was full of the sound and
smell of sizzling sausage nobody said a thing while the giant was
working but as he slid the first six fat juicy slightly burnt
37
sausages from the poker dudley fidgeted a little uncle vernon said
sharply don't touch anything he gives you dudley
the giant chuckled darkly
yet great puddin' of a son don' need fattenin' anymore dursley don'
worry
he passed the sausages to harry who was so hungry he had never tasted
anything so wonderful but he still couldn't take his eyes off the
giant finally as nobody seemed about to explain anything he said
i'm sorry but i still don't really know who you are
the giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back of his
hand
call me hagrid he said everyone does an' like i told yeh i'm
keeper of keys at hogwarts  yeh'll know all about hogwarts o' course
er  no said harry
hagrid looked shocked
sorry harry said quickly
sony barked hagrid turning to stare at the dursleys who shrank back
into the shadows it' s them as should be sorry i knew yeh weren't
gettin' yer letters but i never thought yeh wouldn't even know abou'
hogwarts fer cryin' out loud did yeh never wonder where yet parents
learned it all
all what asked harry
all what hagrid thundered now wait jus' one second
he had leapt to his feet in his anger he seemed to fill the whole hut
the dursleys were cowering against the wall
do you mean ter tell me he growled at the dursleys that this boy 
this boy  knows nothin' abou'  about anything
harry thought this was going a bit far he had been to school after
all and his marks weren't bad
38
i know some things he said i can you know do math and stuff but
hagrid simply waved his hand and said about our world i mean your
world my world yer parents' world
what world
hagrid looked as if he was about to explode
dursley he boomed
uncle vernon who had gone very pale whispered something that sounded
like mimblewimble hagrid stared wildly at harry
but yeh must know about yet mom and dad he said i mean they're
famous you're famous
what my  my mom and dad weren't famous were they
yeh don' know yeh don' know hagrid ran his fingers through his
hair fixing harry with a bewildered stare
yeh don' know what yeh are he said finally
uncle vernon suddenly found his voice
stop he commanded stop right there sit i forbid you to tell the
boy anything
a braver man than vernon dursley would have quailed under the furious
look hagrid now gave him when hagrid spoke his every syllable trembled
with rage
you never told him never told him what was in the letter dumbledore
left fer him i was there i saw dumbledore leave it dursley an'
you've kept it from him all these years
kept what from me said harry eagerly
stop i forbid you yelled uncle vernon in panic
aunt petunia gave a gasp of horror
